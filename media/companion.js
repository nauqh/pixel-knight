	// 64px world grid, which is far too big for a sidebar. So every sheet is
	// downscaled ONCE into an offscreen canvas with nearest-neighbour and every
	// runtime blit reads from that cache at 1:1. Two rules hold:
	//   1. No per-draw fractional scaling. The only resample is the one-time
	//      1/DIV cache build; the whole viewport is then upscaled by an integer
	//      factor Z when the pane is wide enough to earn it.
	//   2. Every destination coordinate is an integer, so a sprite never lands
	//      on a half pixel and shimmers as it moves.
	// Nearest was chosen over box/bilinear by comparison: the smooth filters
	// blur the 1px outlines into mud against the water.

	// on its anchor -- no per-unit rescaling, no cropping. The pack already
	// draws every unit in proportion on a shared world grid, so normalising them
	// to a common "body height" (what this used to do) is what shrank the
	// Lancer: its frame is mostly spear, so fitting the whole frame to a body
